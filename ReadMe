Project Instructions:
Nine coins are placed in a 3x3 matrix with some face up and some face down. You can represent the state of the coins using a 3x3 matrix with values 0 (heads) and 1 (tails). Here are some examples:
000101110
010001100
000100001

Each state can also be represented using a binary number. For example, the preceding matrices correspond to the numbers:
000010000 101001100 110100001

There are a total of 512 possibilities, so you can use decimal numbers 0,1,2,3...,511 to represent all of the states of the matrix.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number between 0 and 511 and displays the corresponding matrix with the characters H and T.
